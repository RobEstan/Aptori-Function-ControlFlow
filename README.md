This is an excerpt of code I have written for the company Aptori during my Summer Internship with them in 2024. I have gotten explicit permission from Travis Newhouse to show this code to the public.

The purpose of this code is to use the ast and os libraries to map out the control flow of functions used in program directories. The code function highlights every function that is used, a list of function call within the functions included in the control flow and the program lines these functions were called at.
